    <h1>Topology</h1>
    <p>This page contains one of the proof of the<strong>Tychonoff’s Theorem. </strong> We want some tools to proove the Tychonoff’s Theorem. 
        We want notation of filters. 
        Further, Munkres proves Tychonoff’s theorem without making mention of filters. 
        Instead, the notion of a maximal collection with the FIP is used.</p>
<div class="definition">
    <h3>Definition <span class="def-number"></span></h3>
    <p>Recall that a collection $F$ of subsets of some set $X$ has the finite intersection property (FIP) if for every finite subcollection $\{F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n\} \subseteq F$ we have
        \[
        \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} F_i \neq \emptyset
        \]
        </p>

<div class="theorem">
    <h3>Theorem <span class="thm-number"></span></h3>
    A topological space $X$ is compact if and only if for every collection $F$ of closed subsets of $X$ with the FIP, we have $\bigcap F \neq \emptyset$.

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p><em>Proof:</em></p>
<p>
$(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $X$ is compact and let $F$ be a collection of closed subsets of $X$ with the FIP. We want to show that $\bigcap F \neq \emptyset$. Suppose for contradiction that $\bigcap F = \emptyset$. Then the sets in $F$ cover $X$, and since $X$ is compact, there is a finite subcover, say $\{F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n\}$. But this contradicts the assumption that $F$ has the FIP, because the intersection of any finite subcollection of $F$ is non-empty.</p>
<p>
$(\Leftarrow)$ Now suppose that for every collection $F$ of closed subsets of $X$ with the FIP, we have $\bigcap F \neq \emptyset$. We want to show that $X$ is compact. Let $\{U_i\}$ be an open cover of $X$. We may assume that the $U_i$ are distinct. Define $F = \{X \setminus U_i\}$. Then $F$ is a collection of closed subsets of $X$ with the FIP. By assumption, $\bigcap F \neq \emptyset$, which means that there is a point in $X$ that is not in any $U_i$, contradicting the fact that $\{U_i\}$ is a cover of $X$. Therefore, $X$ must be compact.

    <h3 id="df3">Definition <span class="def-number"></span></h3>
    Let $C$ be a collection of subsets of a topological space $X$, with the FIP. We say that $C$ is maximal (with respect to the FIP) if whenever $A$ is a collection of subsets with the FIP such that $C \subseteq A$, then $C = A$.
</div>
<div class="theorem"> 
        <h3 id="thm">Proposition <span class="thm-number"></span></h3>
     For every collection of closed subsets $C$ with the FIP, there is a maximal $A$ such that $C \subseteq A$.
</div>
 We will need a theorem (which is called a lemma for historical reasons) from set theory:
<div class="theorem"> 
        <h3 id="thm">Lemma <span class="thm-number"></span> (Zorn's Lemma)</h3>
     Let $(P, \leq)$ be a (non-empty) partially ordered set such that every linearly ordered subset has an upper bound. Then $P$ contains a maximal element.
</div>
The partial order we will consider is the family $T$ of all collections of subsets of a space $X$ with the FIP that contain $C$, ordered by $\subseteq$. Hence, $T \neq \emptyset$ as $C \in T$.
<div class="proof">
    <p><em>Proof:</em></p>
 Let $C$ be a collection of subsets of $X$ with the FIP. Let $A$ be a totally
 ordered subset of $T$, the family of all collections of subsets of a space $X$ with the FIP and that contain $C$. We aim to demonstrate that $A$ has an upper bound.

<p><strong>Claim:</strong> $\bigcup_{F \in A} F$ is an upper bound for $A$.</p>

It is evident that $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \bigcup_{\mathcal{F} \in A} F$ for each $\mathcal{F} \in A$. The remaining part to prove is that $\bigcup_{\mathcal{F} \in A} \mathcal{F}$ has the FIP. Let $F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n \in \bigcup_{F \in A} F$, then there exist $\mathcal{F}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{F}_n$ such that $F_i \in \mathcal{F}_i$ for $i=1 \ldots n$. Since $A$ is totally ordered, there exists a $1 \leq N \leq n$ such that $\mathcal{F}_i \subseteq \mathcal{F}_N$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. Therefore, $F_i \in \mathcal{F}_N$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$ and because $\mathcal{F}_N$ has the FIP, $$\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} F_i \in \mathcal{F}_N \subseteq \bigcup_{\mathcal{F} \in A} \mathcal{F}$$.

Hence, Zorn s Lemma applies and $T$ has a maximal element as required.

    <h3 id="df3">Definition <span class="def-number"></span></h3>
    A collection of subsets $F$ of a space $X$ is called a filter if:
<ol>
</li><li> Finite intersections are contained in $F$. That is: $(\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+})(\forall F_1, \ldots, F_n \in F)[\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} F_i \in F]$
</li><li> $\emptyset \notin F$ and $X \in F$
</li><li> $F$ is closed upwards. That is if $B \subseteq A \subseteq X$ with $B \in F$ then $A \in F$.
</li></ol>
</div>
<strong>Remark</strong> Any filter satisfies the FIP by property (1) and (2).</p>
<div class="definition">
    <h3 id="df3">Definition <span class="def-number"></span></h3>
    Let $F$ be a collection of subsets of a topological space $X$, that is a filter. We say that $F$ is a maximal filter if  $\mathcal{A}$ is a filter of $X$ such that $\mathcal{F} \subseteq\mathcal{A}$, then $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{A}$.
</div>
<div class="theorem"> 
        <h3 id="thm">Example <span class="thm-number"></span></h3>
For the set of real numbers, denoted by $X = \mathbb{R}$, we can examine the following:
<ul>
</li><li> $\mathcal{F}_1 := \{(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R} : 100 \in (a, b)\}$;
</li><li> $\mathcal{F}_2 := \{A \subseteq \mathbb{R} : \exists (a, b) \ni 100, (a, b) \subseteq A\}$; and
</li><li> $\mathcal{F}_3 := \{A \subseteq \mathbb{R} : 100 \in A\}$.
</li></ul>
Here $\mathcal{F}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{F}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{F}_3$  and all three collections have the finite intersection property (FIP). However, $\mathcal{F}_1$ does not qualify as a filter. Because $(99,101)\in \mathcal{F}_1$. But $(99,101)\subsetneq[99,101]\not\in\mathcal{F}_1$. So $\mathcal{F}_1$ does not stratify 3rd condition. While $\mathcal{F}_2$ does, and $\mathcal{F}_3$ is a maximal filter. It is very easy to check other conditions.
</div>
<div class="theorem"> 
        <h3 id="thm">Theorem <span class="thm-number"></span></h3>
If $\mathcal{F}$ is a collection of subsets from a set $X$ that is maximal with respect to the Finite Intersection Property (FIP). Then, $\mathcal{F}$ is a maximal filter.
</div>
<div class="proof">
    <p><em>Proof:</em></p>We have check 3 conditions of definition of filters. Let's check them one by one.

<ol>
<li> The first property holds: We need to show that $\mathcal{F}$ have the finite intersections. Let's consider $F_1, ..., F_n\in \mathcal{F}$. The intersection of these elements, $\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} F_i\neq \emptyset$, due to the FIP of \mathcal{F}. It's clear that the set $\{\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} F_i\} \cup \mathcal{F}$ also satisfies the FIP. Therefore, by the maximality of $\mathcal{F}$, we have$\mathcal{F}=\{\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} F_i\} \cup \mathcal{F}$, Thus $\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} F_i\in F$.

</li><li> The second property holds: Clearly, $\emptyset \notin \mathcal{F}$ as $F$ has the FIP. Thus, $X \cap F = F \neq \emptyset$ for each $F \in \mathcal{F}$. So, $F\cup\{X\}$ has the FIP. By the maximality of $\mathcal{F}$, $\mathcal{F} = F \cup \{X\}$, Thus, $X \in \mathcal{F}$.

</li><li> The third property holds: This proof is simialr to previous one.
</li></ol>
        <p class="qed">∎</p>  
</div>
The most crucial part of a filter is property (1). The only other fact about maximal filters we will need is the following way to identify whether a set belongs to the maximal filter.
<div class="theorem"> 
        <h3 id="thm">Theorem <span class="thm-number"></span></h3>
 Suppose that $F$ is a maximal filter on a set $X$ and $A \subseteq X$. Then,
 $$A \in \mathcal{F} \Longleftrightarrow \forall F \in \mathcal{F}, A \cap F \neq \emptyset$$
   
</div>

<div class="proof">
    <p><em>Proof:</em></p> 
<p>Forward directiona is trivial. Suppose that $A \in F$. By using $F$ has the finite intersection property (FIP) it is very clear that $\forall F \in \mathcal{F}, A \cap F \neq \emptyset$. </p>
<p>Conversely, suppose that $\forall F \in F, A \cap F \neq \emptyset$. We are going to show that $\{A\} \cup \mathcal{F}$ has the FIP, in which case the result follows by maximality of $F$. Let $F_1, \ldots, F_n \in \mathcal{F}$. Since $\mathcal{F}$ is a filter we have that $\emptyset \neq \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} F_i \in \mathcal{F}$. So  by assumption $\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} F_i\right) \cap A \neq \emptyset$. Since $F_1, \ldots, F_n $ are arbitary chosen from $\mathcal{F}$, $\{A\} \cup \mathcal{F}$ has FIP. Since $\mathcal{F}$ is maximal with respect to FIP, then $\mathcal{F}\cup \{A\} =\mathcal{F}$. Therefore, $A\in \mathcal{F}$</p>
