    <h1>Topology</h1>
    <p>This page contains one of the proof of the<strong>Tychonoff’s Theorem. </strong> We want some tools to proove the Tychonoff’s Theorem. 
        We want notation of filters. 
        Further, Munkres proves Tychonoff’s theorem without making mention of filters. 
        Instead, the notion of a maximal collection with the FIP is used.</p>
<div class="definition">
    <h3>Definition <span class="def-number"></span></h3>
    <p>Recall that a collection $F$ of subsets of some set $X$ has the finite intersection property (FIP) if for every finite subcollection $\{F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n\} \subseteq F$ we have
        \[
        \bigcap_{i=1}^{n} F_i \neq \emptyset
        \]
        </p>

<div class="theorem">
    <h3>Theorem <span class="thm-number"></span></h3>
    A topological space $X$ is compact if and only if for every collection $F$ of closed subsets of $X$ with the FIP, we have $\bigcap F \neq \emptyset$.

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p><em>Proof:</em></p>
<p>
$(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $X$ is compact and let $F$ be a collection of closed subsets of $X$ with the FIP. We want to show that $\bigcap F \neq \emptyset$.
   Suppose for contradiction that $\bigcap F = \emptyset$. 
   Then for every point in $X$, there is at least one set in $F$ that does not contain this point. This is equivalent to saying that every point in $X$ is in the complement of at least one set in $F$. Since the sets in $F$ are closed, their complements are open, and the union of these open sets covers $X$.
  Thus there exist a open cover of X and since $X$ is compact, there is a finite subcover, say $\{F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n\}$. But this contradicts the assumption that $F$ has the FIP, because the intersection of any finite subcollection of $F$ is non-empty.</p>
<p>
$(\Leftarrow)$ Now suppose that for every collection $F$ of closed subsets of $X$ with the FIP, we have $\bigcap F \neq \emptyset$. We want to show that $X$ is compact. Let $\{U_i\}$ be an open cover of $X$. We may assume that the $U_i$ are distinct. Define $F = \{X \setminus U_i\}$. Then $F$ is a collection of closed subsets of $X$ with the FIP. By assumption, $\bigcap F \neq \emptyset$, which means that there is a point in $X$ that is not in any $U_i$, contradicting the fact that $\{U_i\}$ is a cover of $X$. Therefore, $X$ must be compact.
