    <h2 id="section1">Boolean Algebra</h2>
    <p>The study of Boolean algebras commences with the definitions of posets, distributive lattices, and totally ordered sets. Once these concepts are established, we can proceed to describe Boolean algebras as a special type of distributive lattice.</p>

    <p>A partially-ordered set, or poset, is a set $A$ in conjunction with a relation $\leq$ that satisfies the following properties:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Reflexivity: For every element $a \in A$, we have $a \leq a$.</li>
        <li>Transitivity: For all $a, b, c \in A$, if $a \leq b$ and $b \leq c$, then $a \leq c$.</li>
        <li>Antisymmetry: For all $a, b \in A$, if $a \leq b$ and $b \leq a$ then $a = b$.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="definition">
    <h2 id="df1">Definition <span class="def-number"></span></h2>
    <p>A totally ordered set, or toset, is a poset $A$ in which any two elements are comparable. That is, for any $a, b \in A$, either $a \leq b$ or $b \leq a$.</p>
</div>

    <h2 id="df2">Definition <span class="def-number">3</span></h2>
    <p>Let $S$ be a finite subset of a poset $A$. The join of $S$, denoted by $\bigvee S$, is a unique element (if it exists) that satisfies the following conditions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Every element $s \in S$ is less than or equal to $\bigvee S$, i.e., $s \leq \bigvee S$ for all $s \in S$.</li>
        <li>If there exists an element $x \in A$ such that every element $s \in S$ is less than or equal to $x$, i.e., $s \leq x$ for all $s \in S$, then $\bigvee S \leq x$.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The join $\bigvee S$ is also known as the least upper bound or supremum of $S$.</p>
    <p>In contrast, the meet of $S$, denoted by $\bigwedge S$, is the dual concept to the join. The meet $\bigwedge S$ is defined in the same manner as the join, but with the direction of the inequalities reversed. It is also referred to as the greatest lower bound or infimum of $S$.</p>

    <p>Let $P$ be a poset. If there exists an element $a \in P$ such that $a \leq x$ for all $x \in P$, then $a$ is called the least or zero element of $P$. It is denoted by $0$. If there exists an element $b \in P$ such that $x \leq b$ for all $x \in P$, then $b$ is called the greatest or unit element of $P$. It is denoted by $1$.</p>

    <p>A lattice is a poset $A$ such that every finite subset of $A$ has both a meet and a join. A lattice is termed complete if it accommodates meets and joins of arbitrary subsets of $A$, not merely finite ones. A lattice is characterized as distributive if the operations of meet and join obey to the distributive law. Specifically, for all $a, b, c \in A$, the following equality holds:</p>
    <p>$$a \wedge (b \vee c) = (a \wedge b) \vee (a \wedge c)$$</p>

    <h3 id="eg1">Example 1</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The operations $\land$ (meet) and $\lor$ (join) in a lattice can be compared to the intersection ($\cap$) and union ($\cup$) operations in set theory. For instance, consider a nonempty set $X$ and its power set $P(X)$, which is the set of all subsets of $X$. If we define the meet and join operations as set intersection and union, respectively, and if we denote the least element as $0 = \emptyset$ and the greatest element as $1 = X$, then $P(X)$ forms a complete distributive lattice under the subset inclusion order. This example illustrates the parallels between set operations and lattice operations.</li>
        <li>In a similar vein, if we have a topological space $X$, the set $\tau(X)$ of all open sets in $X$, when ordered by inclusion, forms a complete distributive lattice. The join operation corresponds to the union of sets, and the meet operation corresponds to the interior of the intersection of sets. This example shows how the structure of a topological space can be viewed as a complete distributive lattice, demonstrating the interplay between topology and lattice theory.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Definition <span class="def-number">1</span></h2>
    <p>Let $A$ be a distributive lattice. For an element $a \in A$, assume there exists another element $\neg a \in A$ satisfying the following conditions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>$a \land \neg a = 0$, and</li>
        <li>$a \lor \neg a = 1$.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <p>Then, we refer to $\neg a$ as a complement of $a$. A distributive lattice where each element possesses a complement is termed a Boolean algebra.</p>

    <div class="theorem">
    <h2>Propoistion <span class="thm-number"></span></h2>
    <p>In a Boolean algebra, complements are unique.</p>
    </div>
      <div class="proof">
    <p><em>Proof:</em></p>
    <p>Assume that for a certain element $a$, we have two complements, denoted as $x$ and $y$. We then have:</p>
    <p>$$
    \begin{align*}
    x & = x \land (x \lor a) && \text{(definition of complement)} \\
    & = x \land 1 && \text{(since $x \lor a = 1$)} \\
    & = x \land (y \lor a) && \text{(since $y$ is also a complement of $a$)} \\
    & = (x \land y) \lor (x \land a) && \text{(distributive law)} \\
    & = (x \land y) \lor 0 && \text{(since $x \land a = 0$)} \\
    & = x \land y && \text{(identity law)}.
    \end{align*}
    $$</p>
    <p>A similar argument can be used to show that $y = x \lor y$.</p>
    <p>Now, from the equation $x = x \land y$, we can infer that $x \leq y$ because the meet operation $\land$ returns the greatest lower bound of its operands. Similarly, from the equation $y = x \lor y$, we can infer that $y \leq x$ because the join operation $\lor$ returns the least upper bound of its operands. Therefore, if $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$, it follows that $x = y$. Hence, the complement of any element in a Boolean algebra is unique.</p>

<div class="theorem">
    <h2>Proposition <span class="thm-number"></span></h2>
    <p>The following properties are valid in Boolean algebras:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Idempotency of meets and joins: $a \land a = a$, and $a \lor a = a$.</li>
        <li>Commutativity of meets and joins: $a \land b = b \land a$, and $a \lor b = b \lor a$.</li>
        <li>Associativity of meets and joins: $a \land (b \land c) = (a \land b) \land c$, and $a \lor (b \lor c) = (a \lor b) \lor c$.</li>
        <li>Distributivity of meets and joins: $a \land (b \lor c) = (a \land b) \lor (a \land c)$, and $a \lor (b \land c) = (a \lor b) \land (a \lor c)$.</li>
        <li>$a \land \neg a = 0$ and $a \lor \neg a = 1$.</li>
        <li>$a \land 0 = 0$ and $a \lor 1 = 1$.</li>
        <li>$a \land 1 = a$ and $a \lor 0 = a$.</li>
        <li>Every element is equal to its double complement: $\neg \neg a = a$.</li>
        <li>$\neg 0 = 1$ and $\neg 1 = 0$.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div Class="proof">
   <p><em>Proof:</em></p>   
<p>For each of these statements, we only need to prove one direction; the other direction follows by duality, i.e., by swapping ∨ with ∧, 0 with 1, and ≤ with ≥.</p>
<p>Statements (1) and (2) are immediate consequences of the definitions of meet and join.</p>
<p>For statement (3), observe that (a ∨ b) ∨ c and a ∨ (b ∨ c) are both upper bounds for the set {a, b, c}, so they must be greater than or equal to the least upper bound of {a, b, c}. Conversely, they must be less than or equal to it, for example, (a ∨ b) ∨ c ≤ (a ∨ b ∨ c) ∨ c = (a ∨ b ∨ c).</p>
<p>Statement (4) holds because a Boolean algebra is distributive by definition.</p>
<p>Statement (5) is the definition of a complement.</p>
<p>Statements (6) and (7) follow directly from the definitions of 0 and 1, and the definitions of meet and join, respectively.</p>
<p>Statement (8) holds due to the uniqueness of complements: ¬ a ∧ ¬ ¬ a = 0 and ¬ a ∧ a = 0, so a = ¬ ¬ a.</p>
<p>Finally, statement (9) follows from statement (6) and the uniqueness of complements.</p>
